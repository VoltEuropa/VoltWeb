        <h1>Become a Member</h1>
        
        <p>Are you interested in joining us and become member ? Below please 
        find some information on the process and what you can expect when joining us.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How do I become a member?</h2>
        <p>
        Becoming member means joining our european community with membership in 
        our national chapter Volt France as well as our European Association (Volt Europa).
        </p>
        <p>
        We have a European-wide membership portal, called, 
        where you can register and apply for membership: 
        </p>
        <a class="volt-content__button" href="https://volt.team/join/fr-FR">Go to volt.team</a>

        <h2>What does it mean to be a Member?</h2>
        <p>
        We are a volunteer organisation working on European, national (, regional)
        and local level. There are more than enough things to do and responsabilities 
        to take on all levels, both administrative and functional. For example 
        developing and contributing to policy topics that interest you, organising 
        local events and participating in other associations, making our IT systems 
        more robust and open source or interviewing and onboarding new members. 
        We have a relatively flat hierarchy, a buddy system to show new members 
        around in our online workplace as well as regular and introductory online 
        calls. After that, you are free to pick your interests, start contributing 
        and hopefully learn how to organise a community and getting more people 
        back involved in politics.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is no written requirement but we are hoping that members can make 
        themselves available a few hours per week to work on projects they care for.
        </p>
        <p>
        In legal terms, being a member means you have a voting right on all member 
        votes being held on your local, national and the european level. Votes 
        include for example whether to accept or reject a new policy, administrative 
        votes for regional representatives and members of the board, which group our 
        elected MEP in Germany should join in the European Parliament or simply the 
        city our next general convention should be held in. As a member you can of 
        course also declare yourself a candidate for every post available.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are in the process of setting up membership fees which will form the 
        future base of having a right to vote. Until the system is setup, all 
        official members can participate in votes.
        <p>

        <h2>What if I am already a member of another political party or if I don't 
        want to become a member?</h2> 
        <p>
        Volt is an open movement. We care more for issues 
        than political colors, which means you are welcome to join one of our local 
        teams and work with us for as long as you like. We are glad and appreciate 
        the time anyone is willing to give towards improving our community and 
        society as a whole and for us, every contribution counts. If at some 
        point you feel like becoming an official member, you will however have 
        to do so without any other active party membership.
        </p>

        <h2>What steps are involved in becoming a member?</h2>
        <p>
        After registering on <a href="https://volt.team/join/fr-FR">volt.team</a> you 
        will be contacted by our HR team for scheduling an interview. Please have a bit
        of patience until we get back to you - our HR team is also made up of 
        volunteers and we're going through applications one by one.
