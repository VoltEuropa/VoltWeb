        <h1>Start a Team</h1>
        <h2>A network of citizen teams throughout Europe</h2>
        <p>
        Our movement is present in 30 European countries with city teams across 
        the continent. We work together on a common platform, which covers European,
        our respective national and local level. This means that while we may still 
        be small in some countries or often only have a few members 
        in a city, we do have a network of many thousand active members
        to fall back upon, exchange ideas and help each other.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are still learning this and finding out how we can turn our network into 
        a real advantage for Volt. City exchanges, cross-border events, helping other 
        countries to campaign - there are many ideas being floated that we just have 
        to try. What we can already say today is that if you like our idea of citizens taking
        political responsibility and think about starting a local team: 
        You will not be alone. There are members assisting with setting up events, 
        creating a web presence and helping with your first activities on the ground.
        We do not offer an established political structure, but a flat hierarchy and 
        passionate movement trying to support everyone showing initiative. 
        <a href="site-contact.html">Get in touch</a> with us if you are interested to find out more.

        <h2>Citizen Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
        We dream of citizens actively taking care of their communities and
        being represented in government. There 
        are many ways to achieve this and we do not claim to have the only answer. 
        Rather we would very much like to cooperate with other citizen initiatives,
        work on common projects and proposals and field joint candidate 
        lists for elections. We've had local independent candidates and movements 
        join Volt in some countries, so this is also a possibility we are happy 
        to discuss. We sincerly hope to offer everyone enough conceptual 
        surface to work towards the best interest of their respective 
        communities, so it comes down to working with us and trying if our purple
        suits you and whether you find enough good reasons to walk with us.
        </p>

        <h2>What does it mean to running a local Volt team?</h2>
        <p>
        First and foremost it will be about growing a team and trying to introduce 
        citizen politics on local level - creating connections with the media, 
        contributing to other initiatives and learning more about your community. 
        Once you have a handful of active members, a city team usually becomes 
        more visible through learning how to contribute to the political discours, 
        or participating in public events. After that, it depends on your 
        objectives and the team you are building.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no best practice for us to grow Volt. We try to provide tools, 
        like our community organising course, a common approach within which 
        to operate and our network to share information on successful events, 
        actions and policies.
