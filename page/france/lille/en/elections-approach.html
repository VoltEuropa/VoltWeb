        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        
        <h2>Politics. By citizens. For citizens</h2>
        <p>
          Volt is a citizen movement. We believe that a society can only exist and 
          flourish if it gives everyone a voice and if it tries to implement an agenda 
          that leaves no one behind - finding a canon and common ground among 
          all the voices loud and silent. Following this principle means more governing 
          with citizens than governing citizens. More listening than speaking. 
          More specific actions than administrative bureaucracy and planning. And 
          more effort, because decisions will have to be made based on the 
          interest of many instead of only a few. We are all volunteers for Volt 
          sharing this idea of empowering citizens and reinventing politics to
          what it needs to be today: Made by citizens for citizens.
        </p>

        <h2>Municipal Elections 2020</h2>
        <p>
          To do this, our goal for the 2020 municipal elections is to assemble 
          a citizen list and participate in the elections.
        </p><p>
          We want to find the best candidates to represent our communities, 
          implement our ideas, be attentive to our needs and to our wishes - we 
          do not require political clout, track record and competence, but 
          candidates who are able to work with 
          people, who can faciliatate and who are willing to take the 
          responsibility that comes with potentially getting elected. Our list 
          is open to all citizens. We don't have a pecking order - the
          eventual position on the list will be determined by a vote among the 
          official members of Volt Lille based on each canidates presentation and 
          engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>United in Diversity</h2>
        <p>
          We hope to be able to join forces with other citizen initiatives 
          and political parties that share our ideas and values - on our list, on 
          a joint initiative, or by sending our candidates to represent Volt 
          within another group. If diversity is our biggest advantage, it 
          should not work against us during campaigns and elections. We will be happy 
          to cooperate with like-minded movements and postpone our programmatic 
          differences until they matter. Because what matters to us is to have a true
          citizen representation elected.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
        Volt strives to be participative. We hope for citizens to participate in our 
        initiatives but are just as eager to contribute to associations and other groups, 
        discussing and gathering ideas for our eventual citizen programme. We are 
        also a progressive movement, so our goals for the most pressing issues
        will be ambitious and our ideas bold. Pollution, public transportation,
        the housing and employment situation, security - there are many topics 
        for which we have to find solutions in the near future. Lastly, Volt is 
        a pan-european mouvement with teams across the continent, exchanging ideas
        and finding best practices that can also be applied here in Lille. Whatever 
        we come up with, we will advocate for our proposals to be adopted, 
        argue for why they should be implemented and hope to be able to implement them ourselves.
        </p>

        <h2>We are all part of the Puzzle</h2>
        <p>
        Is our motto for these elections. Why ? Because life in Lille is often said to be 
        complicated and overwhelming. Similar to a big puzzle. But we can start to see the 
        bigger picture if we begin connecting pieces. If we work togehter. The more 
        pieces we can connect - the more citizens participate - the more 
        stable the connections become and the more we can see what needs to be done.
        Everyone of us is part of this puzzle, which represents our communities and our society as a whole.
        Everyone who cannot participate, everyone who isn't permitted to participate and everyone who does not want to participate
        leaves a gap. Our goal for the 2020 municipal elections is to complete this puzzle in Lille. You are part of it ! We would be happy if you could help.
