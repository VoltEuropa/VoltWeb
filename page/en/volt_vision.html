        <h1>Vision and Values</h1>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <p>
        The vision of Volt is to reclaim politics as a citizen responsibility.
        </p><p>
        The more we delegate responsiblity away through just voting and the more 
        we become disengaged with a political world, which exists for its own 
        purposes and often serves particular interests instead of all citizens, 
        the less we will be able to find answers for the challenges of our time.
        </p><p>
        We are volunteers not career politicans.
        </p><p>
        As citizens we work in local communities and associations across Europe.
        We try to listen, to gather and to exchange ideas, to learn from each 
        other and to collectively come up with propositions that form a political agenda.
        </p><p>
        As members we faciliate dialog between communities and administrations. 
        We take positions and share our proposals for others to implement them.
        We build citizen lists for elections trying to find the best candidates 
        to represent and help govern a community.
        </p><p>
        As elected representatives we work towards implementing our citizen 
        agenda. We continue faciliating and being accessible by our constituencies
        instead of making decisions based on our given position. We adhere to our 
        values and our standards for transparency while trying to set an example
        and redefine politics to something capable of assuring a future worth 
        living in for everyone including the generations to come.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>We have defined the following values as our common ground for our work and for creating our programmes in all European countries:</p>
        
        <h3>Human Dignity</h3>
        <p>
        We believe in the unalterable dignity of the human being. This respect 
        and appreciation for every human being is guiding our policy making at 
        its heart. We believe that no human being is the same and that our 
        diversity enriches our society.
        </p>
 
        <h3>Equal Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
        We believe in the right of everyone to be able to decide their own 
        destiny, no matter where they come from and what their values are. We 
        believe that every human being should be able to unlock their full 
        potential according to their own definition, no matter who they are. 
        We believe everyone should be able to actively participate in society.
        </p>
 
        <h3>Justice</h3>
        <p>
        By default, everyone is equal before the law and laws should not target 
        individuals. We fight every form of discrimination as we believe that 
        every human being should be able to unlock their full potential, no 
        matter who they are. In addition, citizens should be able to trust the 
        reliability and fairness of their state.
        </p><br/><br/>

        <h3>Liberty</h3>
        <p>
        We believe the individual should be free to live her freedom and express 
        her personality, as long as she does not infringe on the rights of somebody 
        else. The person is not only a citizen, but also a private individual, 
        who should be able to live up to their potential outside the political 
        dimension. In addition, the state should always prefer informing and 
        enabling the citizen, rather than forcing them.
        </p>

        <h3>Solidarity</h3>
        <p>
        We are Europe and Europe is Us. If we understand that our individual 
        future is intrinsically linked to the destiny of all other Europeans, we 
        can fully appreciate that solidarity is the foundation of our European 
        society. We believe that solidarity should guide our individual and 
        common actions, and thus our policies. No citizen, no region, no 
        country will be left behind.
        </p>

        <h3>Sustainabilty</h3>
        <p>
        Our focus is progress to a better future, which is why we believe that 
        sustainability is key. Our economies, our individual behaviour, and our 
        stateâ€™s administration should be built to last sustainably, be it in 
        terms of nature, finance, or any other common resources.
