        <h1>About Volt</h1>

        <h2>What is Volt ?</h2>
        <p>
        Volt was created the day the Brexit result was announced and has since 
        grown to be present in 30 European countries with political parties 
        established in 13. We are a movement of citizens volunteering to work 
        towards a more progressive, participative and paneuropean way of doing politics - focussing 
        on redefining what ecologic principles, solidarity and democracy should mean 
        in the 21st century.
        </p>

        <!--figcaption>General Assembly, Amsterdam 2018</figcaption-->
        <p>
        Without much experience or financial means we participated in 
        the European elections in eight countries and succeeded in getting 
        one MEP elected in Germany,
        who members have since voted to join the Group of the Greens/European 
        Free Alliance. Our eyes are now squarely set on upcoming local elections 
        throughout Europe to continue growing our citizen movement which shares the 
        same values and ideas across all countries. 
        </p>
        

        <h2>What's different ?</h2>
        <p>
        The idea of Volt is to give citizens a voice, to facilitate the development 
        of a political agenda focussed on citizens needs' and finding means of 
        adressing these needs - being elected or not. We are mostly volunteers 
        with little political experience, ambition or color. We care for topics 
        and for doing politics in a different way.
        </p>

        <!--figcaption>Volt Lille, Citizen Meetup</figcaption-->
        <p>
        We believe that a democracy should not only mean 
        voting for representatives but to be actively engaged in local communities
        and associtions, to bring up topics that matter, to suggest improvements
        and be in close relation with political constituencies. And as 
        an administration, we must strive to serve all citizens, to be efficient 
        and responsive in meeting evolving needs, to be able listen and to implement 
        an agenda that citizens can rally behind and that tries to propose answers 
        to the challenges facing us today.
        </p>

        <h2>Why going local with a European idea ?</h2>
        <p>
        Volt was born on a day Europe failed to show to show why it matters on national level. 
        But aren't we also failing to also acknowledge why Europe matters on local level ?
        We take peace and stability for granted. We give European names to buildings and regions - Euralille, Métropole Européenne de Lille, Eurometropolis, Euroflanders. 
        But what else ? We don't report about European issues in the news because we believe it does not matter to us ?
        We fail to attract European institutions for lack of international education and transport infrastructure,
        which affects our children and their chances as well as our mobility just as much. We create ambitious 
        cross border integration plans that seem to never get implemented. We worry about
        inner city traffic polluting the air when transit cargo from the north sea ports
        passes through our Lille and MEL area on the road. We claim to be a solidary city, yet have countless homeless people on the streets
        while we make sure migrants are deported out of their shelters and the MEL area altogether. 
        We have large EU budgets available for improving rural and urban infrastructures, yet we rank last in Europe in asking for those
        budgets risking to loose them altogether. Those are European issues that require looking beyond 
        the borders of our municipality to learn from good ideas implemented elsewhere, to 
        point out shortcomings and to work together with all our cultural and national indentities
        to tackle challenges facing everyone of us.
        </p>

        <!--figcaption>Euralille</figcaption-->
        <p>
        We are all part of this puzzle. And we need to work together if we want to ensure 
        our children have opportunities and a future that allows them to grow up. 
        It is our responsiblity and obligation as citzens of Lille. As Nordists. 
        As French. And also as Europeans.
